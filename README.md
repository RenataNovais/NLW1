### ECOLETA PROJECT!

##### Developed during Next-Level-Week-One from [Rocketseat](https://rocketseat.com.br/).

*"NLW is an event with a lot of code, challenges, networking and a single objective: to take you to the next level. Programming is a practical discipline. That is, to master a technology it is not enough to just know the theory or read the documentation: you need to get your hands on the code."*

The purpose of this NLW was to build an application with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and SQL. The **Ecoleta** application consists of a landing page where the user can search for material collection points, a page that shows the search results and a page to add a new collection point.

NLW1 took place in the first week of June 2020. I developed the project in parallel to my Trybe course, in full-stack software development, where I had already studied the basics of CSS, HTML and CSS.

The project is configured to run on a local server, with the command npm start. Feel free to clone, fork or contribute via PR.

Follow some prints of the pages created.

It was a short time project. I hope that I can make it better someday. It has some improvements to be made, but I am happy with the result and feeling good about how much I learned these five days.
